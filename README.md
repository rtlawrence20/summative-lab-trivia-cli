# summative-lab-trivia-cli

In this lab, you will create a Command-Line Interface (CLI) trivia game using JavaScript. This project reinforces your understanding of foundational JavaScript concepts such as handling user input, managing program flow, working with arrays and objects, and building interactive terminal-based applications.

### The Scenario

You are developing a CLI-based trivia game for an online quiz application. The trivia game should provide an engaging user experience by allowing players to answer questions, receive feedback on their performance, and manage their time effectively.

### Your app must satisfy the following requirements:
1. Select answers to questions
2. Get feedback on their answer
3. Get feedback when the game is over
4. Time the game
5. Start a quiz game
6. View quiz questions sequentially

### JavaScript Features
* Integrates loops and functions
* A user friendly CLI
* Integrates asynchronous JavaScript feature: timers
* Uses arrays
* Uses array iteration methods ("map", "filter", "reduce", etc.)
